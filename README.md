This Assignment is written by Cole Fudge(ccid:cfudge). To add a counter, press the plus
sign on the action bar and enter the name of the counter in the dialog that appears.
The options to view statistics for, delete, reset, or rename a counter are available
in the context menu that appears after a long click on any counter. Each counter
is a horizontally oriented linear layout containing a textview for the name and a button 
for incrementing the counter. The counters are all inside one scrollable listview that 
takes up the entire screen of the activity with the exception of the action bar. The 
button in each counter displays the value of that counter and can be pressed to 
increment the counter. The sort icon on the action bar will re-organize the counters 
from highest count to lowest.
